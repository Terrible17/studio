# **App Name**: PleasureX Landing

## Core Features:

- Responsive Background Image: Display the 'background_image.jpg' as a background, ensuring it resizes to fit the screen on all devices and remains centered.
- Static Toolbar: Implement a static toolbar at the top of the page that does not scroll with the content.
- Premium Icon: Include a premium icon (gold color with a red dot) in the toolbar to show upgrade button.
- Theme Toggle: Implement a theme icon that allows users to switch between light and dark themes.
- Menu Icon with Dropdown: Add a menu icon to the toolbar that expands a dropdown menu when clicked.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft pink (#F08080) drawn from the logo in 'background_image.jpg'.
- Background color: Dark charcoal (#292929), very desaturated, nearly identical hue to the pink and providing a dark theme in alignment with the existing color scheme.
- Accent color: Pale gold (#E6BE8A), adding luxury and visual interest to the UI, while contrasting with the dark background. In the original image, a gold element draws focus; this color expands that visual impression across the design.
- Headline font: 'Playfair' serif for headings, for an elegant and high-end feel.
- Body font: 'PT Sans' sans-serif as the body font, ensuring readability and pairing well with 'Playfair'.
- Use simple, outlined icons for the toolbar options (premium, theme, menu).
- Center all content vertically and horizontally on the page, ensuring it remains consistent across all devices.
- Subtle fade-in animations when loading content or transitioning between themes.
